## For Noobs
Welcome to the Python Binary Search project!

This repository contains a Python script that implements the binary search algorithm. Binary search is a fundamental algorithm used to efficiently search for an element in a sorted list.

If you're new to programming or Python, don't worry! The script is well-commented and easy to understand. You can learn a lot by reading through it and experimenting with the code.

Feel free to explore the code, try running it with different input lists, and see how the algorithm works!

## For Nerds
Greetings, fellow nerd!

In this repository, you'll find a Python script (`script.py`) that implements the binary search algorithm. Binary search is a classic algorithm used to efficiently locate a target value within a sorted list.

The script contains a function `binary_search()` that takes a sorted list and a target element as input and returns the index of the element if found, or -1 if not found. The algorithm employs a while loop for iterative binary search.

Additionally, you'll find a `LICENCE` file containing the MIT License for this project, granting you permission to use, modify, and distribute the software.

Lastly, the `.gitignore` file includes rules to ignore commonly generated files and directories, ensuring a clean repository.
